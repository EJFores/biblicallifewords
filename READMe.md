# Biblical Life Words 
biblelifewords.org

## What is this?

This is a website created to return a randomly selected verse from a set list of verses. 
These bible verses were shared by friend of mine who is a pastor. They are for their youth group to read daily.
I decided to turn this list into a website that will deliver the verses digitally for those folks who don't carry a non-laminated piece of paper around.
I also included some verses that were helpful to me as well.

## FAQ
##### *Why not just use the YouVersion Bible app?*
- You can! In fact, I encourage you to take the verses you get from this generator and read more for yourself!
- Not every experience with the Bible has to be online, you can also use a physical one too!
##### *Why are you using the ESV translation of the Bible as a default?*
- The ESV translation has a free API that can be used to return verses so it was easy to implement first.
##### *What is this project built with?*
- This project is built with Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and Bulma CSS. Maven is the dependency manager.

## Plans for the future
- find other versions to add other than ESV
- consider implementing a small ml model to select random verses so long as it can verify the verse actually exists.
